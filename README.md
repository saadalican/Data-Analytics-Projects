Report Created on Power BI

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "ecommerce_customer_data_1.csv" file which I got fro Kaggle, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

### Sales and Revenue Trends Over Time
Explore how sales and revenue have evolved over the years.

### Top Performing Product Categories
Identify the product categories contributing the most to sales and revenue.

### Distribution of Sales by Payment Method
Analyze the distribution of sales among different payment methods.

###Impact of Customer Churn on Sales
Investigate how customer churn affects sales and revenue.


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales was best performing in "Books" category followed by "Clothing" category.
2. Highest number of orders were made by customer whose age was 64 followed by Age 18 and 21.
3. Customer segments was almost equally divided between Male and Female buyers.


### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. The data was randomly generated throught python, access to real time data would have given more valuable insights.
