Report Created on Power BI

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset utilized in this analysis was meticulously maintained and curated by the project owner. It comprises real-time sales data collected on a weekly basis from Croma H.O team to Amkette.


### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating Stock & Sales Dashboards


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Loading and inspection of data.
2. Handling and rectification of missing or erroneous values.
3. Cleaning and formatting of data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales and stock data to answer key questions, such as:

### Sales and Revenue Trends for FY 22-23
Examining the sales trend across 432 stores pan-India throughout the years 2022 to 2023.

### Top Performing Products 
Identify the products contributing the most to sales and which products have slow stock movement.

### Impact of Festive Seasons on Sales
Investigating the spike in sales during festive seasons, noting the percentage increase.


### Results/Findings

Through my analysis, I uncovered several noteworthy findings:

1. Festive seasons, particularly spanning from October to December, emerged as peak periods, driving significant sales volumes.
2. The concentration of stores, notably in tier 1 cities, underscores the demand for diverse product offerings and accessibility to a wide range of choices.
3. Store segmentation into categories (A-D) revealed that top-tier stores (A) provided extensive product assortments, with each store offering over 5000+ SKU's.
4. Bundled product offerings, especially during back-to-school promotions, captured increased consumer interest, highlighting the effectiveness of bundled deals and promotional incentives.
6. The rising popularity of gaming products and innovative accessories outpaced traditional computer accessories, reflecting evolving consumer preferences and lifestyle trends.
7. Enhanced product knowledge and sales training for store staff, coupled with incentive programs, proved instrumental in boosting sales performance and customer engagement.

These insights provide valuable guidance for Amkette to better understand consumer behavior, refine their product offerings, and optimize their sales strategies for improved business outcomes.


### Limitations
1. Product Code Management: Difficulty arose when removing obsolete products due to issues with product codes.
2. Data Formatting Variability: Handling data in different formats from Croma H.O. required time-consuming fixes, highlighting the need for standardized data formats and communication protocols.

This project offers valuable insights into sales trends, stock management, product performance, and customer behavior, facilitating informed decision-making and performance analysis.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "ecommerce_customer_data_1.csv" file which I got fro Kaggle, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

### Sales and Revenue Trends Over Time
Explore how sales and revenue have evolved over the years.

### Top Performing Product Categories
Identify the product categories contributing the most to sales and revenue.

### Distribution of Sales by Payment Method
Analyze the distribution of sales among different payment methods.

###Impact of Customer Churn on Sales
Investigate how customer churn affects sales and revenue.


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales was best performing in "Books" category followed by "Clothing" category.
2. Highest number of orders were made by customer whose age was 64 followed by Age 18 and 21.
3. Customer segments was almost equally divided between Male and Female buyers.


### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. The data was randomly generated throught python, access to real time data would have given more valuable insights.
